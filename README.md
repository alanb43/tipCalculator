# Pre-work - *Tip Calc*

**Tip Calc** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Alan Bergsneider**

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## User Features

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Ensuring the decimal pad drops when the user desires with a simple tap on the screen, in order to return to full view of the screen.

## Notes

When initially learning how to push / pull / commit through Xcode, I accidentally pulled the project back to the beginning / having nothing. 
Re-did the project. May further add functionality and features as I develop skills and proficiencies.
